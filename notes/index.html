<p><a href="https://github.com/JoseCuevasBtos/Serre-l-adic-Representations">J.-P. Serre. <em>Abelian $\ell$-adic representations and elliptic curves</em></a><br>
This book, published originally in 1989 by Addison-Wesley, is a classic onewith   two main issues for future diffusion: the first being that it is out
of print; and the second being that it is written in typewriter machine,
which can be aesthetically repulsive to certain readers.
The need for this book is that modern texts on elliptic curves or abelian
varieties don&rsquo;t go deep enough on the subject (including Silverman&rsquo;s
<em>Advanced topics&hellip;</em>), while it is still acknowledged as obligatory for
investigation purposes.</p>
<p>Alongside <a href="https://josecuevas.xyz/">José Cuevas</a> we decided to perform the
project of re-typing it in modern LaTeX, while still maintaining most of the
original style.
The project is still ongoing, but you can download the temporary pdf file <a href="https://github.com/JoseCuevasBtos/Serre-l-adic-Representations/raw/main/main.pdf">here</a></p>
