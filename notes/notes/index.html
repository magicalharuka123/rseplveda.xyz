J.-P. Serre. Abelian $\ell$-adic representations and elliptic curves
This book, published originally in 1989 by Addison-Wesley, is a classic
onewith two main issues for future diffusion: the first being that it is out
of print; and the second being that it is written in typewriter machine. The need for this
book is that modern texts on elliptic curves or abelian varieties don’t go
deep enough on the subject (including Silverman’s Advanced topics…), while
it is still acknowledged as obligatory for investigation purposes." />

<p><a href="https://github.com/JoseCuevasBtos/Serre-l-adic-Representations">J.-P. Serre. <em>Abelian $\ell$-adic representations and elliptic curves</em></a><br>
This book, published originally in 1989 by Addison-Wesley, is a classic
onewith two main issues for future diffusion: the first being that it is out
of print; and the second being that it is written in typewriter machine. The need for this
book is that modern texts on elliptic curves or abelian varieties don’t go

it is still acknowledged as obligatory for investigation purposes.</p>
<p>Alongside <a href="https://josecuevas.xyz/">José Cuevas</a> we decided to perform the
project of re-typing it in modern LaTeX, while still maintaining most of the
original style. The project is still ongoing, but you can download the
temporary pdf file <a href="https://github.com/JoseCuevasBtos/Serre-l-adic-Representations/raw/main/main.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>We thank <a href="https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~schoof/">René Schoof</a> and Jean-Pierre Serre himself for their corrections to the project.</p>
